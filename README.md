Since the Videofile , Trained model, and model weigths file was too large, hence I have uploaded them on google drive as I was not able to upload them on github. 
To store the entire model artifacts like Trained model, model weights, evaluation metrics I have used **amazon's s3 bucket**. These are then later fetched according to the use.
